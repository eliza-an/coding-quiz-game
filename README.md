  # Coding Quiz Game

  # Description
  This was another challenge for trillogy skills bootcamp. The acceptance criteria were as follows:   GIVEN I am taking a code quiz. WHEN I click the start button. THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question. WHEN I answer a question. THEN I am presented with another question. WHEN I answer a question incorrectly. THEN time is subtracted from the clock. WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. THEN the game is over. WHEN the game is over. THEN I can save my initials and score. This was by far one of the most challenging challeneges of the bootcamp. The implementation of the local storage and the timer were extremely difficult to grasp, however after several failed attempts, this is what I managed to come up with. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to learn such complex but interesting concepts.

  ## Usage

  Simply click the Start quiz button on the starting page. Next answer each question by clicking the button that you believe contains the right answer. If you are correct, you will be able to continue without time being decudcted. If you are wrong, 5 second will be deducted from the timer. The quiz will end if the timer runs out or you answer all of the questions!
